Data in this folder is from the [M5 forecasting dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy/rules) uploaded to Kaggle in March of 2020.  
Dataset summary:
- It used hierarchical sales data, generously made available by Walmart, starting at the item level and aggregating to that of departments, product categories and stores in three geographical areas of the US: California, Texas, and Wisconsin.
- Besides the time series data, it also included explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events (e.g. Super Bowl, Valentineâ€™s Day, and Orthodox Easter) that affect sales which are used to improve forecasting accuracy.
- The distribution of uncertainty was assessed by asking participants to provide information on four indicative prediction intervals and the median.
- The majority of the more than 42,840 time series display intermittency (sporadic sales including zeros).
- Instead of a single competition to estimate both the point forecasts and the uncertainty distribution, there were two parallel tracks using the same dataset, the first requiring 28 days ahead point forecasts and the second 28 days ahead probabilistic forecasts for the median and four prediction intervals (50%, 67%, 95%, and 99%).
- For the first time, it focused on series that display intermittency, i.e., sporadic demand including zeros.
